### ðŸ’¡Description:

This lab contains aÂ reflected cross-site scriptingÂ vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets are encoded. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls theÂ `alert`Â function.

### ðŸ’¡Lab Answer:

First we check the search bar and trying to put a random text:

- Wow, we noticed that when i searched by `Test` in search bar the script code appear in **web page source:**

```jsx
var searchTerms = 'Test';
document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
```

- The code snippet demonstrates how user input is being used to construct an HTML **`img`** element with a source attribute (**`src`**).
    - Let's break down the code step by step:
        - **`document.write(...)`**: The **`document.write()`** function is used to dynamically generate and insert content into the HTML document. In this case, the code is generating an **`img`** element and appending it to the document.
        - **`searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'"`**: This part of the URL is where the JavaScript variable **`searchTerms`** is being included in the **`src`** attribute. Here's what's happening:
            - **`searchTerms=`**: This is a query parameter in the URL.
            - **`encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)`**: The value of the **`searchTerms`** variable is being URL-encoded using the **`encodeURIComponent()`** function. URL encoding is necessary to ensure that special characters, spaces, and other URL-unsafe characters are properly represented in the URL.
            - **`'+"`**: This part concatenates the encoded value of **`searchTerms`** to the URL.

- According to this XSS documentation, when the possible xss is inside a Javascript code we can use this payload:Â `'-alert(1)-'`
