### Description
What is the CVE ID that is related to EternalBlue

Flag Format: XXX-XXXX-XXXX

### Lets Solve This..!

##### What is EternalBlue?
EternalBlue is a Microsoft exploit which was used by the NSA in intelligence gathering operations. The exploit, officially named MS17-010 by Microsoft ‚Äî gave the US National Security Agency (NSA) backend access to devices running Windows operating systems like Windows XP and Windows 7.

# 4. Backdoor
### Description

```python 
Our server compromised due to known vulnerability introduced from many years, Kindly check and identify this flow 
X: Attack source ‚Üí EX. ‚ÄúInternal/External‚Äù
Y: The Source IP ‚Üí x.x.x.x
Z: CVE Num of the attack ‚Üí xxx
W: Destination Mac Address
Flag format: flag{X:Y:Z:w}
Link: https://to-be-uploaded
```

### Tools:
- Wireshark

üö©Challenge [Link](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/backdoor.pcap)


### üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªLets Solve This..!
let‚Äôs open the ```backdoor.pcap``` file with wireshark first, then lets show the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics and start first by filtering FTP traffic.

<p align="center">

</p>

Filtering FTP traffic.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/7.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Selecting FTP protocol will generate search for subjected traffic and display fields like source, destination, destination port and info, From there we can see these traffic between two internal IP addresses 

üí°Wireshark provides the feature of reassembling a stream of plain text protocol packets into an easy-to-understand format.

By selecting first packet (Right-Click) ‚Üí Follow ‚Üí TCP stream 
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/8.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>
This is the result:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/9.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>
Here from the result we have useful information like:
- The FTP server receive the request from user and user name / password used for this authentication

##### Lets try to make this info useful ü§î

From the challenge description we know the the server is compromised by specific vulnerability and our task is to identify the root cause.

Googling the server ```version``` from the discovery result, we can notice its vulnerable to backdoor was introduced into the ```vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz``` archive.

Let's search about this vsFTPd 2.3.4 vulnerability in [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

This is the result:
[vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49757)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/10.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Now lets try to cocatinating  the flag:
- From PCAP analysis Both attacker and server have internal IP address in the range 192.168.1.0/24 So the attack scope is Internal this is the ```X``` portion
- From PCAP analysis we can get the ```Y``` part that is the source IP of the attecker
- Now we can get the ```Z``` part from the flag from above ```CVE ID``` 
- The last part of this flag ```W``` lets back to wireshark packets list to get the details, We could extract all Src/Dest network traffic details.

# 5. Creepy DNS
### Description

Our NMS detect a suspected traffic, your task is to investigate the captured traffic and find the anomaly reason.

### Tools:
- Wireshark
- Tshark
- CyberChef (Website)

üö©Challenge [Link](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/dns.pcapng)


### üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªLets Solve This..!

let‚Äôs open the ```dns.pcapng``` file with wireshark first, then lets show the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics and start first by filtering DNS traffic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/1.png" alt="Protocol Hierarchy Statistics" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Filtering DNS traffic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/2.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

If we search through the traffic we can see at one point that there are many DNS requests to ```[x].cybertalents.com.```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/3.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Let‚Äôs use ```Tshark``` to filter and collect all the letters.

```python
tshark -r dns.pcapng -Y "dns.qry.type == 1" | grep 'cybertalents.com OPT' | cut -d 'A' -f 2 | uniq | cut -d '.' -f 1 | tr
```
- Dns.qry.type: filter only DNS requests (type ==1). 
- The rest of the commands are bash tricks to sort the input.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/4.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

We got what seems like a flag encoded in base64.

Let's Decode the string by using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/)

# 6. WormSeen

### Description
OOur EDR has flagged suspicious traffic from production endpoint, after reviewing the respective process generating the traffic and another alert has been alerted ‚ÄúWorm Detected‚Äù in our SIEM

You decided to escalate the case to IR team to further investigate and answer the below questions 

Questions:

1. What is the range of worm spreading (x.x.x.x/xx) ?
2. Destination target port of the attack (XX)?
3. How many hosts might be affected by the worm (XX)?
 
- Flag format: flag{Answer1:Answer2:Answer3}.

### Tools:
- Process Hacker
- wireshark

üö©Challenge [Link](https://hubchallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/foren/worm.zip)


### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Lets Solve This..!

Lets try to unzip the `worm.zip` in my isolated windows 10 machine, execute this file and show the result in `Process Hacker` tool.

Open `Process Hacker` after you run the `worm.exe`:

| ![Process List](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/1.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Screenshot for the execution of the .exe file* |

Now lets look to `Process Hacker` and see if any change will be happend:

| ![Process List](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/2.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *worm.exe Process* |

Then go to network tap to see the connection that the file make:

| ![Process List](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/3.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *worm.exe Network* |

From above image after the file was executed it started to scan the network Lets open `Wireshark` to see the range of scaned network and answer the flag.!

| ![Process List](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/4.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Wireshark* |

Now we want to know the range of ip address that the file scaned lets know from wireshark direct from first ip `192.168.1.171` and the last one `192.168.1.255`

| ![Process List](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/5.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Endpoint statistics* |

Now concatenate all above answer to capture the flag..!

# 7. Bean

### Description

Come back home Mr. Bean.

### Tools:

- dirsearch

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Lets Solve This..!

First install the dirsearch tool for directory brute forcing by using this command:

```python
apt install dirsearch
```

Now lets open the URL in browser:

| ![Bean](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/bean/1.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Come back home Mr. Bean.* |

Second we use the dirsearch to scan the challenge url:

```python
dirsearch -u <URL>
```

Result:

```python
[13:14:29] Starting: 
[13:15:27] 301 -  185B  - /files  ->  http://*********-web.cybertalentslabs.com/files/
[13:15:28] 200 -    9KB - /files/
[13:15:31] 200 -  404B  - /index.html
```

Lets try this directories in url:

| ![Bean](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/bean/2.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Files* |

From descrition line that tell us `Come back home Mr. Bean.`

Now we try go to the home directory of  Mr. Bean and see the result using the url:

```python
http://*********-web.cybertalentslabs.com/files/../home/
```

| ![Bean](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/challenge/bean/3.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Files* |

Woow! we find the flag.txt file lets open this file and summit the flag.
