# 4. Backdoor
### Description

```python 
Our server compromised due to known vulnerability introduced from many years, Kindly check and identify this flow 
X: Attack source ‚Üí EX. ‚ÄúInternal/External‚Äù
Y: The Source IP ‚Üí x.x.x.x
Z: CVE Num of the attack ‚Üí xxx
W: Destination Mac Address
Flag format: flag{X:Y:Z:w}
Link: https://to-be-uploaded
```

### Tools:
- Wireshark

üö©Challenge [Link](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/backdoor.pcap)


### üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªLets Solve This..!
let‚Äôs open the ```backdoor.pcap``` file with wireshark first, then lets show the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics and start first by filtering FTP traffic.

Filtering FTP traffic.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/7.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Selecting FTP protocol will generate search for subjected traffic and display fields like source, destination, destination port and info, From there we can see these traffic between two internal IP addresses 

üí°Wireshark provides the feature of reassembling a stream of plain text protocol packets into an easy-to-understand format.

By selecting first packet (Right-Click) ‚Üí Follow ‚Üí TCP stream 
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/8.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>
This is the result:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/9.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>
Here from the result we have useful information like:
- The FTP server receive the request from user and user name / password used for this authentication

##### Lets try to make this info useful ü§î

From the challenge description we know the the server is compromised by specific vulnerability and our task is to identify the root cause.

Googling the server ```version``` from the discovery result, we can notice its vulnerable to backdoor was introduced into the ```vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz``` archive.

Let's search about this vsFTPd 2.3.4 vulnerability in [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

This is the result:
[vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49757)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/10.png" alt="FTP" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Now lets try to cocatinating  the flag:
- From PCAP analysis Both attacker and server have internal IP address in the range 192.168.1.0/24 So the attack scope is Internal this is the ```X``` portion
- From PCAP analysis we can get the ```Y``` part that is the source IP of the attecker
- Now we can get the ```Z``` part from the flag from above ```CVE ID``` 
- The last part of this flag ```W``` lets back to wireshark packets list to get the details, We could extract all Src/Dest network traffic details.

# 5. Creepy DNS
### Description

Our NMS detect a suspected traffic, your task is to investigate the captured traffic and find the anomaly reason.

### Tools:
- Wireshark
- Tshark
- CyberChef (Website)

üö©Challenge [Link](/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/dns.pcapng)


### üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªLets Solve This..!

let‚Äôs open the ```dns.pcapng``` file with wireshark first, then lets show the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics and start first by filtering DNS traffic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/1.png" alt="Protocol Hierarchy Statistics" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Filtering DNS traffic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/2.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

If we search through the traffic we can see at one point that there are many DNS requests to ```[x].cybertalents.com.```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/3.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

Let‚Äôs use ```Tshark``` to filter and collect all the letters.

```python
tshark -r dns.pcapng -Y "dns.qry.type == 1" | grep 'cybertalents.com OPT' | cut -d 'A' -f 2 | uniq | cut -d '.' -f 1 | tr
```
- Dns.qry.type: filter only DNS requests (type ==1). 
- The rest of the commands are bash tricks to sort the input.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/CyberTalents/SOC_Analyst/4.png" alt="DNS" style="width:1000px">
</p>

We got what seems like a flag encoded in base64.

Let's Decode the string by using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/)
